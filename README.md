# climate-crop-impact
This project analyzes the impact of climate change on staple crop production by examining the relationships between temperature, precipitation, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Using machine learning models, we predict future crop yields based on changing climate conditions.

üîç Key Features:
Data Processing & Cleaning (handling missing values, normalization).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (visualizing trends in climate factors).
Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Model Evaluation (MSE, residual analysis, actual vs. predicted values).
Future Yield Predictions (projecting impacts of climate change).

üìä Visualizations Included:
Climate variables over time.
Correlation matrix between features.
Model performance plots (actual vs. predicted, error distribution).
